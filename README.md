### Hi there 👋

- 💭 It all started as a concept - I've always loved computers and finding ways to make things work. At my job I am often the go-to "tech-support" person, so why not make it a career? I joined the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp in May of 2021 and graduated October 2021 with a new perspective and understanding of front and back-end technology as a fullstack developer.

- 📝 As a writer and educator, I feel particularly equipped to break down complex ideas in an easily digestible manner. As a technical writer I believe I'd excel in delivering easy-to-understand translations between developers and consumers.
